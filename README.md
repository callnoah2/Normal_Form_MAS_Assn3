## Functions

There are functions to find:
Strictly dominated strategies
Weakly dominated strategies
Pure strategy equilibria (Nash Equilibria)
Pareto Optimal Solution
Minimax strategies
Maximin strategies
A function to find the rewards of solutions where players use different strategies
A function to print the table (useful for debugging)
A function to split the input into a 3 dimentional matrix

## Usage

This program has pre-made datafiles in the data directory, these datafiles are in the following format

Number of actions for row player, number of actions for column player
Row player rewards (in row major order)
Column player rewards (in row major order)

To add more, add the file path to the paths list.

## suggestions for improvement

I made the function to print the table as an improvement, the list of strategy cominations could have been made with a nested loop.
